## 🗂️ [Logs](./logs)
Access the central archive of all completed surgical records. This directory browser lists all signed PDF logs uploaded from the iPad, organized by project folders (e.g., SWR-VNS, Pilots). I'm keeping this updated for my own projects as a postdoc rather than projects I'm helping out with only. Other projects may have some files here saved but definitely not all. This starts from 2025-09.

## 📚 [Resources](./resources.html)
A curated library of surgical guides, aseptic technique manuals, and institutional position statements. These reference materials represent a synthesis of knowledge accumulated from prior research affiliations and mentorships.
