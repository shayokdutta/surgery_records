## II. Surgery Day Setup
**1. Room & Equipment Prep**
* **Clean:** Mist Cavicide or 70% Ethanol on surgery table, stereotax, arms, scope, drill, and light source. Wipe down.
* **Heating Pad:** Wrap in blue pad (diaper), tuck under stereotax, turn ON.
* **Stereotax:** Clean earbars/nosecone with ethanol. Tighten loose screws.
    * *Kemerelab Settings:* Left earbar ~8mm; Bite bar ~6.5mm.
* **Anesthesia:** * Check Isoflurane level (> 3/4 full).
    * Weigh/replace carbon trap (scavenger).
    * Open O2 valve (Rice: 860B).
* **Aspiration/Vacuum Setup:** Beaker with 10% bleach solution (20ml bleach + 180ml water).

**2. Drug Preparation**
* **Weigh Animal:** Calculate dosages based on weight.
* **Buprenorphine (Ethiqa):** * *Dose:* 0.03 mg/kg SC (or check bottle instructions).
    * *Note:* Use between shoulders.
* **Lidocaine 2%:** Draw with 23Ga (for rat) or 25Ga (for mouse) needle (Max 0.5ml/kg).
* **Meloxicam:** For post-op analgesia (2 mg/kg SC. Typically going to be 5 mg/ml).
* **Fluids:** 3-5 syringes of Lactated Ringer’s solution (warm if possible; 10ml/kg or 1ml/100g).
* **Topical:** Ophthalmic ointment & 2% Lidocaine cream.

**3. Shay logging methods**
- Convert markdown/html surgical template to PDF then edit PDF on iPad 
	- Spray iPad and Apple Pencil with 70% ethanol AFTER noting induction time in step below.

## III. Anesthesia & Positioning
1.  **Induction:**
    * Place rat or mouse in chamber, Isoflurane @ 5 or 2.5%, O2 flow @ 1-2 L/min, respectively depending on species.
    * *Watch breathing:* Ideal 60-70 bpm. If gasping, reduce Iso.
    * **Safety:** Never leave room once animal is under or ask someone to watch the animal!
2.  **Shaving:**
    * Transfer to nosecone (reduce Iso to 2-3% for rat or to 1-2% for mouse).
    * Inject **Ethiqa/Buprenorphine** SC between shoulders now (Rice)
    * Shave from mid-eyes to behind ears for cranial surgeries. *Careful of whiskers.* Shave from animal's left shoulder area up to bottom of chin for vagus nerve surgeries whilst they are in a supine position. *Be very gentle with shaving*
	    * For mice, especially with for the cervical shaving, Shay recommends to use Nair briefly to get rid of excess hair as that may sneak into the open surgical site.
		    * Leave Nair on for about 15-20 seconds and clean with DI water/sterile cotton swabs
3.  **Stereotax Mounting (if needed):**
    * Apply Lidocaine cream to ear bars.
    * Mount rat or mouse: Ear bars in canal crease. Ensure head does not move side-to-side.
    * Secure bite bar (tongue to side) and nose cone. Tighten dorsal screw.
    * Ensure head does not move up or down
    * **Check:** Breathing (no gasping), Skull Leveling.
4.  **Sterile Prep:**
    * Apply eye ointment + foil shades (for rat).
    * Scrub scalp with **Iodine** (3x spiral from center out). Wipe with saline or ethanol.
    * Inject **Lidocaine** SC at incision site (base of skull to eyes and retract slowly while injecting).
	    * Inject **Lidocaine 0.05 ml** SC at cervical incision site. *CAREFUL of not injecting too much or going too deep here as that could significantly hurt the animal based on location of the injection*
    * Spray glove/tools/drill with 70% Ethanol.

## IV. Surgical Procedures

### Cranial Procedures
#### 1. Incision & Exposure
* Incision: Midline from eyes to back of skull (~1.5 inch) for rats; For mice, just cut out the skin with fine scissors.
* Retraction: Place 4 hemostats/clips. *Ensure flat field.* (FOR RAT ONLY)
* Cleaning: 
	* Rat: Scrape tissue/periosteum with skull scraper from center out
	* Mouse: Wipe skull with sterile cotton swab dipped in saline first and clear out any blood. Follow this with brief touch of ethanol on saline which will dry out the skull enough for any cranial implants according to Cristin (headbars specifically, for microdrives you will need anchor screws).
* *Goal:* Bregma and Lambda must be clearly visible.
* Hemostasis: Use bone wax or cautery if necessary. *This **should not** be **necessary** in **mice**!*

#### 2. Calibration
* Mount 32G (or finest available) needle or calibration tool.
* Measure Bregma (B) and Lambda (L).
* **Level Skull:** Z-difference between B and L should be **< 0.3mm** for rats, whereas, for mice Shay would shoot for **< 0.1mm**. Adjust bite bar if needed.

#### 3. Anchors & Craniotomy
* **Drilling Screws (if needed):**
    * Rats: 
	    * Use FG2 bit. Low speed.
	    * Pattern (for hippocampal target): 4 Anterior, 2 Posterior (avoid craniotomy sites).
    * **Ground Screw:** Posterior location. Drill until deep red/blood seen. Screw in immediately (1-2 turns).
* **Metabond Base:**
    * Clean skull of blood.
    * Apply Metabond (4 drops liquid : 1 scoop powder : 1 drop catalyst) around screws. Place liquids and powder in separate wells and mix to consistency that you need. *Avoid craniotomy site.*

#### 4. Specific Procedure Branches

##### Option A: Microdrive Implant
1.  **Craniotomy:**
    * Use FG 1/4 bit for rats. Use finer available drill bits for mice
    * Drill target coordinates (see reference below).
    * Remove bone island carefully (don't push down!).
    * Remove Dura (bend 27G needle tip to make incision into dura and lift).
	    * There are a million different ways to do a clean duratomy. Just be careful and avoid blood vessels lines and have a plan of incision and peeling of dura before you get started. Adjust as needed and ask for tutorials from multiple people. Not one way is correct or better on this! You'll find your own best practice.
2.  **Insertion:**
    * Mount drive to arm. Align vertical.
    * Lower until bundle touches cortex surface.
    * **Drive:** Lower to target depth (e.g., -0.8mm for cortical touch or specific coord).
3.  **Sealing:**
    * Apply Silicone Sheet or Kwik-Sil or Duragel around edges. 
	    * For larger sized electrodes (i.e., not tetrodes), silicone sheet or duragel is recommended as Kwik-Sil will adhere to the electrode making it not drivable; thus, defeating the purpose of a microdrive.
    * Build metabond followed by (in mice) acrylic column from bottom up to secure drive to skull/screws.
	    * This takes practice but can be done very cleanly and look pretty! 
    * **Grounding:** Connect ground wire to ground screw pin. Cover with acrylic. 
    * **Tip:** Use UV curing acrylic! Makes life much faster/easier and avoids potential exothermic reaction issues caused to the brain when occurring on the skull surface for extended durations. 

##### Option B: Stereotaxic Injection (Hamilton)
1.  **Prep:** Clean syringe with acetone/distilled water.
2.  **Test:** Push "Run" to verify flow.
3.  **Target:** Go to coordinates.
    * *Technique:* 
	    * Rats: Lower 2mm past target, retract 1mm (create pocket), or specific depth.
	    * Mice: TODO. Ask Ziying. He's done this.
4.  **Inject:** * Rate: ~0.05 - 0.2 ul/min.
    * Wait time: 5-10 mins post-injection before retracting.

##### Option C: Aspiration & GRIN Lens
1.  **Durotomy:** Remove dura over aspiration site.
2.  **Aspiration:** Vacuum (10% bleach trap) to remove cortex to desired depth.
3.  **Implant:** Lower dummy/GRIN lens to target. Cement in place.
### Vagus Nerve Surgeries

#### 1. Incisions

#### 2. Field of view
## V. Closing
1.  **Kwik-Sil:** Apply to any exposed brain/craniotomy gaps.
2.  **"Dust and Squirt":**
    * Acrylic powder + Liquid monomer.
    * Cover all screws and ground wire connections.
    * *Warning:* Do not let acrylic run into eyes *(your's or the rodent's!)*
3.  **Suturing:**
    * Simple interrupted or running sutures for skin around the implant. 
	    * See suturing resources for further details!
    * Vetbond on knots (if not confident/needed)

## VI. Post-Operative Care
**1. Immediate (Unconscious)**
* Turn off Isoflurane, O2, Flush O2.
* Remove mouse/rat from ear bars gently.
* *Apply fresh eye ointment.*
* Place in recovery cage on heating pad.
* **Administer Fluids:** Lactated Ringers SC (5ml or 0.2ml for rats or mice, respectively).
	* This isn't necessary but it aids recovery regardless of when fluid function returns.

**2. Recovery (Conscious)**
* Monitor for "Righting Reflex" (rodent can flip itself over).
* Return to clean cage with food/water.
* **Analgesia:** Meloxicam (Day 0, 1, 2 post-op).

**3. Cleanup**
* Discard sharps/biohazard.
* Wash tools ( enzymatic cleaner -> DI water (technically for 10-12 hours) -> brush tools with toothbrush and soap -> Dry).
* Wipe down stereotax.
